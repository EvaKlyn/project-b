# Project B
game i'm making for fun in godot

stuff
- networked multiplayer (client/server)
- and the multiplayer is actually done somewhat properly
- but it was mainly just for ergonomics
- ALSO a lot of basic functionality like multiple self-contained worlds loaded and networked at once

appendix N/lofty ideals
- main combat mechanics inspired by early 3d zeldas and resident evil 4 weirdly
- structural elements inspired by early editions of dnd
- sandbox/immersive sim(?) elements from a lotta places
